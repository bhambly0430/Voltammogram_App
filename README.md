# Voltammogram Application

## Installation Instructions
1. Click the green Clone or download button and download the ZIP file.
2. Open the downloaded ZIP file.
3. Find and double click on the “Voltammogram_Calculator_web.exe” and move it to the desktop.
4. Double click on the Voltammogram_Calculator application.
5. Continue with the installation.

The application requires the MATLAB runtime engine, and its installation is built into the .exe installation process.  If you have questions please email me at bhambly@memphis.edu.

## Basic Usage
1. Enter model parameters in the Model Control panel.
2. Using the drop-down menu select a model.
3. Click calculate in the Model Control panel.
### Export data
To export your data as a .CSV click the Export to CSV button in the Model Control panel.  This will only export the data for the __one__ curve.  For exporting data for multiple curves use the memory function.

## Memory Usage
0. Clear memory using the red Clear Memory button.  The counter should go to zero once you click the button.
1. Enter the parameters for your first simulation in the Model Control panel and select your model from the drop-down menu. 
2. Click the green "+ Memory" button to run the simulation and store the results in the memory. 
3. Run as many simulations as desired making sure you click the + Memory button after each. You should see the counter increase upon each additional simulation.
4. Plot the memory using the Plot Memory button or export memory using the Export Memory button.
5. The memory can be cleared using the red Clear Memory button.
